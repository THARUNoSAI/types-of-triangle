Get the three angles of a triangle as
input.



 



find the count of the type of the triangle.



 



Continue the process for 5 times.



 



If the sum of the three angles is greater
than 180 then prompt for correct values. (the sum of all internal angles of a
triangle is always equal to 180째). Keep the count of the wrong entries also.



 



Acute Angled Triangle (all three angles
less than 90째)



 



Right-Angled Triangle (one angle that
measures exactly 90째)



 



Obtuse Angled Triangle (one angle that
measures more than 90째)
